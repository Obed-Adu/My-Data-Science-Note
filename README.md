# My Data Science Notes

Welcome to my Data Science Notes repository! This is a personal learning journal and project hub where I document my journey through Python for Data Science and related tools, frameworks, and concepts.

## Overview

This repository contains organized notes, code snippets, exercises, and project files as I learn and practice data science. It is part of my coursework on platforms like IBM SkillsBuild, where I am exploring topics such as:

- Python programming
- Data structures and control flow
- Reading and writing files
- Working with data using Pandas
- Data cleaning and analysis
- Jupyter Notebooks and visualization

## Structure

The content is organized into modules that reflect the learning curriculum:

- `Module 1`: Python basics and data types
- `Module 2`: Control flow and functions
- `Module 3`: File operations
- `Module 4`: Working with Pandas and CSV files (in progress)
- `Notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files with practice examples and exercises
- `resources/`: Extra materials and datasets used in practice

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.11.0+
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

## Purpose

The aim of this repository is to:

- Keep a structured and accessible record of my learning
- Showcase progress to potential collaborators or employers
- Encourage consistency and documentation habits

## Getting Started

To view or run the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/Obed-Adu/My-Data-Science-Note.git
2. Open with VS Code or Jupyter Notebook

3. Make sure required packages are installed:
   pip install pandas notebook
